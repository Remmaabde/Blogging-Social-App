# Building Trust: Why Ethical AI Matters

AI is powerful, but without ethics, it can cause harm.  
Responsible AI means designing systems that are **fair, transparent, and accountable**.

## Core Principles
1. **Fairness**: Avoiding bias in decisions.
2. **Transparency**: Explaining how AI works.
3. **Accountability**: Knowing who’s responsible.
4. **Privacy**: Protecting personal data.
5. **Human oversight**: People stay in control.

## Why It Matters
If people don’t trust AI, they won’t use it — no matter how advanced it becomes.

Ethics isn’t optional. It’s the foundation for AI’s future.
