# AI in Smart Homes: Making Your Living Smarter

Smart homes are evolving from voice‑activated gadgets to intelligent environments that learn from you.

## From Automation to Intelligence

AI‑powered homes anticipate your needs: dimming lights when you relax, adjusting temperature based on your habits.

## Key AI Uses
- **Personalized climate control**
- **Adaptive lighting**
- **Enhanced security with AI vision**
- **Energy optimization**
- **Context‑aware voice assistants**

## The Next Step
Future homes will *think with you*, adjusting seamlessly to your life without you asking.  
Not just connected — truly intelligent.
