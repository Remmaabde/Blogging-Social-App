Content Policy: All blog posts must maintain a positive and professional tone. Avoid controversial or political topics. All content must be original and free of plagiarism.

SEO Guidelines: Posts should be optimized with 3-5 relevant keywords. The primary keyword should appear in the title and the first paragraph. Use clear headings (H1, H2, H3) to improve readability and search engine ranking.

Branding: Use the company's brand voice. For blog posts, this voice is described as "professional, friendly, and informative." Never use informal slang or overly technical jargon without explanation.
