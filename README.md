# Blogging Social App - MERN Stack

This project is a full-stack social blogging application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). 
It allows users to register, login, create and manage blog posts, comment, like posts, 
follow other authors, and includes admin controls and JWT authentication. 
The backend exposes RESTful APIs that the React frontend consumes via AJAX requests.
